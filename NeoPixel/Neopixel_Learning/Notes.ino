/* Create a way to take time between steps that doesn't use delay
 *  Need to flash the stick until the first down compression
 *  Need a function to update the stick by sweeping the pixels
 *  Call it every 5 seconds or so or at the same time as we post the BPMs
 *  Need to flash the stick interestingly when the count goes to zero to show the user they're done
 *  Map the time value to the 24 pixels
 * Create a variable to set the stick color?
